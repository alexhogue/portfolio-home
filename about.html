                <p>Hello! Thank you for checking out my portfolio:)</p>
                <p>I'm a digital product designer with a focus on cognitive science and accessibility. I enjoy helping 
                    people feel seen through my work. I've previously worked as a Medical Illustration intern at UNC Hospital
                    where I worked to create visual communication tools for Neurosurgeons that effectively captured complex
                    medical topics. 
                </p>
                <p>I am currently a dual-degree student majoring in Computer Science at Brown and Illustration at the 
                    Rhode Island School of Design, and I love exloring ways to merge these interests in my work.
                </p>
                <p>I'm from North Carolina, and I love to read, travel, and try vanilla lattes at every cafe I find!</p>
