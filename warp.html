              The goal of this project was to design a home page for the startup Warp that serves as 
              an aggregator to allow for increased discovery and usage of Warp’s features.
              My team worked directly with the founders to create this design.

                is a customizable terminal with collaborative tools and AI integration. We were tasked with designing their

                  and customizability. My team worked collaboratively throughout the process, each giving constant input and feedback.

              <p>Warp is a reimagined command-line terminal; it is an AI driven platform that allows developers to efficiently 
                  code in the terminal and work collaboratively.</p>

          </video>
          <h3 class="h3-section">Problem</h3>
          <p>Warp does not currently have a centralized home page for users to view information about 
                their files, teams, usage, account info, and learn more about Warp. Right now, most of 
                this information is housed in settings, making it difficult and unintuitive for users to find, especially
                new users who would be unfamiliar with the Warp system.</p>
          <p><span class="important">Users impacted: </span>This feature would be most useful for existing Warp users who are somewhat seasoned with 
              the product, but this would also be an important introduction to Warp for new users through
              product education feature opportunities.</p>
          <h3 class="h3-section">Solution</h3>
          <p>We designed a centralized home page that adapts to a user's state (new vs. seasoned user) in order to 
              efficiently provide users access to their work, teams, personal information, and educational resources.
              We focused on <span class="important">accessibility</span> to make Warp more efficient for users to 
              navigate and more <span class="important">approachable to new users</span> by adding direct access to education materials 
              and Warp communities.

                <li>focus on intuitiveness with inspiration from Figma Home, Google Drive and GitHub home</li>

          <p>
            The goal was to create a <span class="important">user-friendly</span>, glanceable interface that allows 
            users to understand their current state and easily access their content.</p>
          <p>We achieved this through a split layout: the left sidebar displays metrics, live 
            sessions, activities, and resources, and the main section displays folders, 
            files, and sessions. Additionally, since Warp is designed for collaboration, it was
            critical for users to seamlessly switch between personal and team
            views.

          <h3>Revisions</h3>
          <p>
              Based on feedback from the Warp founders as well as peers, we revised our initial drafts with the following in mind:
          </p>
          <ul id="revisions">
              <li>We felt that having four screens was too few to demonstrate user interaction, so we 
              created more screens.</li>
              <li> We removed metrics from the left sidebar to clean up the sidebar as it did not feel necessary for users
              to constantly see this information (better in the account page).</li>
              <li>We want to make the drive more customizable and we added sorting, filters, and two modes for viewing.</li>
              <li>We changed the toggle (navigating between “Personal” and “Team”) to a drop-down
              since the founders clarified that in the future Warp would allow users to be on
              multiple teams.</li>
              <li>We wanted to make it easy to navigate between
              the home page and terminal and opted to use a top nav bar, added a new tab for the home page, 
              replacing the drive tab since drive is now integrated into the home.</li>

            <h4>User Considerations</h4>
            <p>We based the style guide on the current Warp brand guidelines, adding additional 
              elements including specific font sizes and an icon library to match our design. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Warp brand guidelines focus on a minimal, dark-mode style. This allows the product to work seamlessly for developers, 
                who often work with software in dark mode.
              <li>Users are often online for long periods of time, so having a website that is minimalistic, professional, 
                and easy to read is critical. </li>
              <li>The main font is sans-serif, simple, and readable, and the terminal font is very similar to that of 
                other terminals on the MacOS and Linux systems, aligning with users' mental model.</li> 
              <li>Warp uses primarily black and white of varying shades, matching with the dark mode 
              theme as well as additional colors as accents that create fun and eye-catching elements that 
              make Warp more than a basic terminal.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h4>Accesibility</h4>
            <p>We checked the style guide with WCAG (Web Content Accesibility Guidelines) and found that the dark gray on black could 
              be an issue for accessibility, so we added more contrast between the text and buttons and the background. 
              The icons are minimalistic and simple to make it clear what each icon represents to a user.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="h3-section">Final Prototype</h3>
        <p>Our prototype uses the same structure and design as our final wireframe which is shown and 
          described above. We added in new colors, fonts, and icons as indicated by our style guide to 
          bring our design to life. The design focuses on depicting the design of the home page based 
          on the user state and the various actions that they can take.</p>
        <h4>Active user navigating through their personal home page to a team drive:</h4>
        <video id="highfiVid" loop autoplay muted>
          <source src="assets/warp/highfi.mp4" type="video/mp4" alt="user navigating through the final high-fi design">

        <h4>Admin's team drive:</h4>
        <img class="highfiImg" src="assets/warp/highfi-admin.png" alt="high-fi for team admin page"/>
        <p>We  emphasized key design principles in our prototype to fulfill our users' needs and
          ensured that our design aligns with the mental model users currently have of a 
          homepage/dashboard.</p>
          <p>We implemented hierarchical design to create an efficient layout for users. The 
          scan pattern is based on the F pattern, where users scan horizontally across the top, then vertically 
          down the left side, and finally horizontally across the screen. With this in mind, we have the welcome 
          and navigational information across the top, the sidebar on the left side with key information, and 
          access to files in the center of the screen. This allows users to quickly find what they need on 
          the page. Along with clear layout, I also ensured that there was sufficient contrast for <span class="important">
          accessibility</span>.</p>

            to implement to revise the design as well as inspire future projects:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Think about what will happen when the sidebar gets filled with a lot of activity information. How will it
                stay clean and clear?
              </li>
              <li>Consider the order of content displayed to new users; perhaps educational content should be first and the 
                page update as the user becomes more experienced. 
              </li>
              <li>Explore where the members, settings, and billings buttons would direct an admin</li>

            <p>Doing this project, I learned a lot about designing as a team and working with clients in order 
              to achieve a design goal. Communication was a huge part of this process– both within 
              my team and with the startup founders. From the very beginning, I prioritized understanding the needs 
              and expectations of our client, which involved active listening during meetings, thoughtful questions, 
              and thorough documentation of their thoughts and feedback.</p>
            <p>One key challenge was translating their vision into tangible designs. This required not 
              only creative problem-solving but also a deep understanding of design principles and user experience.
              My team took their feedback and continuously iterated on our designs, constantly striving 
              to align to their expectations while incorporating our own expertise and insights.</p>
