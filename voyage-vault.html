          <p>The goal of the project was to design and build an interface for users to create their dream travel bucket list, share 
            their travel experiences, and explore others' travel opinions.</p>
          <p>The final product is a fully functional interactive interface that displays travel destinations to users, allows them to 
            sort and filter the options, and add their favorites to their "vault" which functions as an aggregator to display users' 
            selections "vault".</p>

        <h3 class="h3-section">Problem</h3>
        <p>How can I create an app for people who want to travel–particularily those looking to travel somewhere new–
            but are struggling to figure out their ideal destination?</p>
        <h3 class="h3-section">Solution</h3>
        <p>Using a clearly structured layout that displays options to users as well as an accessible pannel to "store" 
            favorite makes this process easy. Additionally, features such as ranking and sorting destinations by various features
            as well as popularity allows users to find thier ideal destinations. This would be helpful for inexperiened travellers
            who as well as experienced travelers looking to learn about new destinations.

      <h2>Preperation</h2>
      <p>I began the design process by analyzing and drawing comparisons between various existing interfaces that implement a favoriting
        feature in order to figure out the clearest and most effective way to implement my travel bucket list builder.

          <h3>Planning</h3>
          <p>I began by planning out my design using Figma with a focus on clarity and accessibility.</p>
          <p>Using the information gleaned from my competitive comparison and initial design, I took the elements from the three interfaces
            that were most effective, and revised elements that were less effective.</p>

            <h4><b>Layout</b></h4>
            <p>The purpose of the app is to provide users with travel destination ideas and allow them to build their travel bucket 
              list and view other users opinions and rankings. It is important that the travel information for each destination be
              clearly layed out into item cards for users to easily browse.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="choices">
              <h4><b>Sort and Filter</b></h4>
              <p>Because travel is incredibly distinct to each individual's 
              preferences, sorting and filtering the options is extremely useful. I created the options for users to sort by most liked destinations 
              and filter destinations by both continent as well as desired activity (e.g city, beach, and adventure focused destinations).</p>

            <div id="choices">
              <h4><b>Aggregator</b></h4>
              <p>The user is then able to add their favorite destinations to their travel vault. The vault is the aggregator that displays the users choices 
              in a section to the left of the travel grid so that users can easily view and update their list as they browse.</p>

    <div id="conclusion">
      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p>With this project, I learned a lot about designing and building an intuitive and functional interactive interface. I 
        refined my skills in programming with React to implement my UI after completing the design process. I
        also learned about the considerations and intricacies that go into building an interface at both a the design stage
        and the implementation stage; both require structured planning in order to figure out the best way to acheive the project
        goal. I look forward to continuing to develop my design and front-end programming skills. </p>
      <div id="takeaways">
        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p><span class="important">Clear and Accessible Layout:</span> Providing a clear layout with all options readily viewable enhances usability and allows users to 
          easily navigate and interact with the interface.</p>
        <p><span class="important">Simplified Interaction:</span> Using clear icons and limiting excess wordiness helps streamline user interactions and reduces 
          cognitive load, resulting in a more efficient and enjoyable user experience.</p>
        <p><span class="important">Flexibility and Feedback:</span> Offering options for sorting, favoriting, and removing items, along with clear feedback 
          mechanisms, empowers users to customize their experience and provides valuable feedback on their actions.</p>
